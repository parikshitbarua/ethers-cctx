}


return type: {
"transaction hash": TransactionResponse.hash,
"block number": TransactionResponse.blockNumber,
"from": TransactionResponse.from,
"to": TransactionResponse.to,
"ether value": ethers.formatEther(TransactionResponse.value)
}

## 2.  cctx

1. get the list of coin which is tradable on Binance.
